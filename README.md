# class-and-objects
A user-defined data type called a class acts as a guide for building objects. The characteristics (data members) and actions (member functions or methods) that an object of a class will possess are defined by the class. Whereas, an object is an instance of a class. 

To create a class we follow-

-Define the class- We begin by using the class keyword, followed by the name of the class and specify whether public, private or protected as needed.

-Define Data Members- Inside the class we declare data members to represent the attributes of the class.

-Define member functions.

-Create Objects of the Class- create objects of the class using the class name followed by an object name.

-Access class members.

-Define the functions used

-At the end, use class in your main program.
